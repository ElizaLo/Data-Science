## Machine Learning Lifecycle Platforms

| Title | Description|
| :---: | :--- |
|[MLflow](https://mlflow.org)|<ul><p>MLflow is a platform to streamline machine learning development, including tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. MLflow offers a set of lightweight APIs that can be used with any existing machine learning application or library (TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, etc), wherever you currently run ML code (e.g. in notebooks, standalone applications or the cloud).</p><li>[MLflow GitHub](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow)</li></ul>|
|[Aporia](https://www.aporia.com)|<ul></p>The Monitoring Platform for Machine Learning<p><li>[Aporia GitHub](https://github.com/aporia-ai)</li><li>[ML Platform Workshop](https://github.com/aporia-ai/mlplatform-workshop)</li></ul>|
|[Comet.ml](https://www.comet.ml/site/data-scientists/)|<ul><p>Comet is doing for ML what Github did for code.</p><p>Track your datasets, code changes, experimentation history, and models. Comet provides insights and data to build better models, faster while improving productivity, collaboration and explainability.</p></ul>|
|[DVC](https://dvc.org)|<ul><p>Data Version Control, or DVC, is a data and ML experiment management tool that takes advantage of the existing engineering toolset that you're already familiar with (Git, CI/CD, etc.).</p></ul>|

## Tools

| Title | Description|
| :---: | :--- |
|[Synapse Machine Learning](https://github.com/microsoft/SynapseML)|<ul><p>Simple and Distributed Machine Learning</p><p>SynapseML (previously MMLSpark) is an open source library to simplify the creation of scalable machine learning pipelines. SynapseML builds on Apache Spark and SparkML to enable new kinds of machine learning, analytics, and model deployment workflows. SynapseML adds many deep learning and data science tools to the Spark ecosystem, including seamless integration of Spark Machine Learning pipelines with the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), LightGBM, The Cognitive Services, Vowpal Wabbit, and OpenCV. These tools enable powerful and highly-scalable predictive and analytical models for a variety of datasources.</p></ul>|

### Docker Commands

- Build **image**

      docker build -t [testimage (name of image)] .

- Build **container**

      docker run --name [name of container] -p [ports] [name of image]
      docker run --name testcontainer -p 8080:80 testimage

- Use 'docker scan' to run Snyk tests against images to find vulnerabilities and learn how to fix them

      docker scan

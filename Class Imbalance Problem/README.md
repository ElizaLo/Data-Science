# Class Imbalance Problem

- Downsampling majority class 
- Altering the loss function to penalize on class
- Upsampling the minority class

## Oversampling

In signal processing, **oversampling** is the process of sampling a signal at a sampling frequency significantly higher than the Nyquist rate. 

## Downsampling

In signal processing, **downsampling** is the process of reducing the sampling rate of a signal. This is usually done to reduce the data rate or the size of the data. The downsampling factor is usually an integer or a rational fraction greater than unity.

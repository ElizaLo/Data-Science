### Methods of optimization:

- Curve Fitting

## Curve Fitting

**Curve fitting** is a type of optimization that finds an optimal set of parameters for a defined function that best fits a given set of observations.

Unlike supervised learning, curve fitting requires that you define the function that maps examples of inputs to outputs.

The mapping function, also called the basis function can have any form you like, including a straight line (linear regression), a curved line (polynomial regression), and much more. This provides the flexibility and control to define the form of the curve, where an optimization process is used to find the specific optimal parameters of the function.

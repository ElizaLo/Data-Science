## The Data Science Interview Preparation 

### Typical interview construction

1. Software Engineering (for more visit [Interview Preparation](https://github.com/ElizaLo/Interview-Preparation) Repository)
2. Applied Statistics
3. Machine Learning
4. Data Wrangling, Manipulation and Visualisation

### 2. Applied Statistics

- **Descriptive statistics** (What distribution does my data follow, what are the modes of the distribution, the expectation, the variance)
- **Probability theory** (Given my data follows a Binomial distribution, what is the probability of observing 5 paying customers in 10 click-through events)
- **Hypothesis testing** (forming the basis of any question on A/B testing, T-tests, anova, chi-squared tests, etc).
- **Regression** (Is the relationship between my variables linear, what are potential sources of bias, what are the assumptions behind the ordinary least squares solution)
- **Bayesian Inference** (What are some advantages/disadvantages vs frequentist methods)

1. [Introduction to Probability and Statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/), an open course on everything listed above including questions and an exam to help you test your knowledge.
2. [Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Machine-Learning-Optimization-Perspective-Developers/dp/0128015225) by Sergios Theodoridis. This is more a machine learning text than a specific primer on applied statistics, but the linear algebra approaches outlined here really help drive home the key statistical concepts on regression.

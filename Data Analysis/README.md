## How To Select Columns Using Prefix/Suffix of Column Names in Pandas?

### Select Columns with a Prefix using Pandas filter

For example, if we are interested in selecting columns starting with `“lifeExp”`, the regular expression for the pattern is `“^lifeExp”`. In the regular expression `“^”` represents we are interested in patterns that starts with. So our argument for `“regexp”` will be `regexp=’^lifeExp’`.

```python
df.filter(regex='^lifeExp',axis=1).head()
```

### Select Columns with a suffix using Pandas filter

Let us select columns with names ending with a suffix in Pandas dataframe using filter function. As before, we need to come up with regular expression for the pattern we are interested in. Here our pattern is column names ending with a suffix.

Let us select columns ending with `“1957”` and the regular expression pattern is `‘1957$’`, where the dollar symbol at the end represents the pattern ending with `“1957”`.

We use `regex=’1957$’` as argument to the Pandas’ filter function and addition to `axis=1`. We get a data frame with three columns that have names ending with 1957.

```python
df.filter(regex='1957$',axis=1).head()
```

- Amazon initially decided to launch their first personalized product recommendations based on an [A/B test showing a huge revenue increase by adding that feature](http://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/GuideControlledExperiments.pdf). (See the second paragraph in the introduction.)
- LinkedIn [tested whether to use the top slot on a user's stream for top news articles or an encouragement to add more contacts](http://engineering.linkedin.com/mobile/mobile-ab-testing-linkedin-how-members-shape-our-apps). (See the first paragraph in "A/B testing with view based JSON" section.)
- Amazon determined that [every 100ms increase in page load time decreased sales by 1%](http://www.exp-platform.com/Documents/IEEEComputer2007OnlineExperiments.pdf). (In "Secondary metrics" section on the last page)
- Googleâ€™s [latency results](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/06/speed-matters.html) showed a similar impact for a 100ms delay.

### Other Examples:

Khan Academy [tests changes like letting students know how many other students are working on the exercise with them, or making it easier for students to fast-forward past skills they already have](http://apptimize.com/blog/2014/07/how-khan-academy-uses-ab-testing-to-improve-student-learning/).

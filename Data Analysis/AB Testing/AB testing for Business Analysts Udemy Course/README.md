Alteryx is a data analytics software. You can find out more about [Alteryx here](https://www.alteryx.com/).

Here is a list of free courses that can help you get familiar with this software:

## Randomized Experiment

### More Detail on Unit of Diversion Web Experiments
Udacity has another course entire focused on web-based A/B tests. If you'd like to dive into more detail on unit of diversion, go [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud257/lessons/4001558669/concepts/39700990000923).

Here are the main questions you need to address to design a randomized experiment:
- What is the unit of diversion?
- What is the population of people we're targeting?
- What is the duration of the test?
- What is the size of our treatment and control groups?

## T-Tests Types
There are three types of t-tests you can use: **paired, the equal variance, or the unequal variance**. In a random experiment you will usually assume that variances between the groups are different, so weâ€™ll use an unequal variance t-test.

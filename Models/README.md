# Models

## Generative models

Types of generative models are:

- Gaussian mixture model (and other types of mixture model)
- Hidden Markov model
- Probabilistic context-free grammar
- Bayesian network (e.g. Naive bayes, Autoregressive model)
- Averaged one-dependence estimators
- Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
- Boltzmann machine (e.g. Restricted Boltzmann machine, Deep belief network)
- Variational autoencoder
- Generative adversarial network
- Flow-based generative model
- Energy based model
- Diffusion model
